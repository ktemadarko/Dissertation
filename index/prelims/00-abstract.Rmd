The influence of space on fertility is unclear, while the influence of compositional and contextual determinants are more clearly understood. At the local level within England and Wales, fertility varies vastly from lowest-low fertility to levels well above replacement level. Using small-scale, neighbourhood-level data on socio-demographic, economic and contextual conditions, this dissertation aims to isolate and explain the role of spatial influence and contagion on fertility. Methodologically, Ordinary Least-Squares regression is compared to four spatial models: the Spatial Lag Model, Spatial Error Model, Spatial Durbin Model and Spatial Durbin Error Model. Theoretically, the diffusion of ideals and norms is cemented in demographic approaches to fertility change. This approach is followed here, namely through the role of social networks and the small-scale transmission of ideas and norms. Education, ethnicity, income, population density, divorce prevalence, social support and non-religiousness test significant, with university-level education and ethnicity hosting the greatest improvements in model performance. The inclusion of endogenous and exogenous spatial components vastly improves explanatory power, that is, including dependence between neighbourhoods both in relation to fertility behaviours and the explanatory variables. However, she sub-regional analysis of spatial processes requires further research in isolating the exact role of social contagion on fertility. \par
